        The purpose of this project is to better understand 
        the methods and outcomes of regression analysis using machine learning techniques 
        and to do inferential modeling to discover the most important features when predicting
        life expectancy for different US populations. The data on which the model is based comes from
        the <a href = "https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/studies/nlms/">National Longitudinal Mortality Survey</a>, 
        a project from the US Census consisting of a "database developed for the purpose of studying the effects of demographic and 
        socio-economic characteristics on differentials in U.S. mortality rates." (Quote taken 
        from <a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/research/nlms.Project_Overview.html">their website</a>.)
