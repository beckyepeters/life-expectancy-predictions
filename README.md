Life Expectancy

The purpose of this project is to create a predictor system for life expectancy in the US based on one's year of birth, race, and gender. Exploratory Data Analysis was performed on multiple datasets to make connections between life expectancy trends and predictions. 

The plan is for this to be completed by utilizing grouped life expectancy time series data as well as individual data
